        <h4>My Journey</h4>
        <p>Welcome! I’m <b>Sara Hashemi Nasab</b> — an entrepreneurial spirit, lifelong learner, and lover of meaningful connections. I’m passionate about blending <b>knowledge, creativity, and nature</b>
             to create experiences that inspire growth and authenticity.</p>
<p>My journey bridges many worlds — from <b>entrepreneurship and emotional intelligence to art, design, and wellness</b>. I’m endlessly curious about how science and self-awareness can help us live with more clarity, compassion, and creativity.</p>

<p>Beyond <b>business and research</b>, I find joy in <b>nature walks, dance, and art</b> — spaces where I can <b>reflect, recharge, and express myself freely</b>. Whether designing clothes, painting, or simply sharing ideas, I see creativity as a way to connect deeply with others and the world around us.</p>

<p>This website is more than <b>my personal corner</b> of the web — it’s a <b>celebration of collaboration, exploration, and growth.</b> I’m honored to share it with the wonderful people who make every project meaningful.</p>

  <h4>My Vision</h4>
  <p>
    I envision a world where leaders lead with empathy, products are crafted with consciousness, 
    and communities thrive through authentic connection with nature and one another. 
    Through <b>Wild Connections</b>, I’m committed to turning this vision into reality — 
    one mindful conversation, one natural product, one transformative experience at a time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Alongside creating <b>natural skincare</b> that nurtures both skin and soul, 
    I also share <b>psychological teachings</b> and <b>leadership insights</b> that help others 
    grow with confidence, compassion, and purpose. 
    Together, we explore how wellness and wisdom can shape the way we live and lead.
